Place your own binary files here if you want them to be used instead of the built-in ones provided by the target system.

Your binary files need to be placed within the following directory structure: OPERATING_SYSTEM/ARCHITECTURE

OPERATING_SYSTEM must be one of the following options (in lowercase): android, aix, freebsd, linux, macos, netbsd, netscaler, openbsd or solaris
ARCHITECTURE is the kernel architecture (in lowercase). It can be retrieved via 'uname' tool.

Examples:
android/aarch64
aix/powerpc
linux/armv7l
linux/i686
linux/ppc64le
linux/x86_64
macos/x86_64
