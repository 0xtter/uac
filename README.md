UAC is a Live Response collection script for Incident Response that makes use of native binaries and tools to automate the collection of AIX, Android, ESXi, FreeBSD, Linux, macOS, NetBSD, NetScaler, OpenBSD and Solaris systems artifacts. It was created to facilitate and speed up data collection, and depend less on remote support during incident response engagements.

## üåü Main Features

- Runs everywhere with no dependencies (no installation required).
- Customizable and extensible collections and artifacts.
- Respects the order of volatility during artifacts collection.
- Collects information from processes running without a binary on disk.
- Extracts information from files and directories to create a bodyfile (including enhanced file attributes for ext4).
- Hashes running processes and executable files.
- Collects user and system configuration files and logs.
- Collects artifacts from applications.
- Acquires volatile memory from Linux systems using Microsoft's [avml](https://github.com/microsoft/avml) tool.

## üíæ Supported Operating Systems

UAC runs on any Unix-like system (regardless the processor architecture). All UAC needs is shell :)

## üöÄ Using UAC

UAC does not need to be installed on the target system. You only need to download the latest version from the [releases page](https://github.com/tclahr/uac/releases), uncompress and run it. As simple as that!

A profile name and/or a list of artifacts, and the destination directory need to be provided in order to run a collection. The remaining parameters are optional.

Common usage scenarios may include the following:

**Collect all artifacts based on the ```full``` profile, and create the output file in ```/tmp```.**

```shell
./uac -p full /tmp
```

**Collect all ```live_response```, and the ```bodyfile/bodyfile.yaml``` artifact, and create the output file in the current directory.**

```shell
./uac -a live_response/\*,bodyfile/bodyfile.yaml .
```

**Collect all artifacts based on the ```full``` profile, but excludes the ```bodyfile/bodyfile.yaml``` artifact, and create the output file in ```/tmp```.**

```shell
./uac -p full -a \!bodyfile/bodyfile.yaml /tmp
```

**Note that when a profile and a list of artifacts are provided, the artifacts from the profile will always be collected first, even if the parameter ```-a``` was provided before ```-p``` in the command line. In the example below, the ```memory_dump/avml.yaml``` artifact will only be collected after all artifacts from ```full``` profile were collected.**

```shell
./uac -a memory_dump/avml.yaml -p full /tmp
```

**Collect all artifacts based on the ```full``` profile, but limiting the data collection based on the date range provided.**

```shell
./uac -p full /tmp --date-range-start 2021-05-01 --date-range-end 2021-08-31
```

**Collect all but live response artifacts from a Linux disk image mounted in ```/mnt/ewf```.**

```shell
./uac -p full -a \!live_response/\* /tmp --mount-point /mnt/ewf --operating-system linux
```

Please check the [project documentation page](https://tclahr.github.io/uac-docs) for more information about command line options, how to create your own artifacts, profiles, and more!
